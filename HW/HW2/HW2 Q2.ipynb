    "In a Materials informatics workflow you need to find and clean data, featurize the data, train models, and use models for some task. A few years ago, we put together a nice series of notebooks that describe this process for an example where we train heat capacity data as a function of temperature and composition and then use this model to predict heat capacity as a function of temperature for new materials. The best practices document is a great starting point for you and can be found here `https://github.com/anthony-wang/BestPractices`. I'd like you to go through a similar exercise as the best practices notebook but with a few changes. \n",

We were silly and didn't know about `GroupKFold` in teh scikit-learn library. (`https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GroupKFold.html`) Redo the splitting process using this much simpler tool. \n"

I'd like you to build two models and perform hyperparameter tuning on them. One model should be either `Ridge` or `Lasso` and the other should be `XGBoost`. Compare performance metrics including training time. "
