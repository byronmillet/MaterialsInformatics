To get a property let's search for a materials project entry using the cif cards! If you've forgotten how, go back to the `legacy_MPRester_tutorial.ipynb` notebook where we did an example. Once you have the material project id, run a query to extract a property like bulk modulus ([\"elasticity\"][\"K_VRH\"])"
